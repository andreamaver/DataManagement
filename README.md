The project consists in the creation of a graph database built around the Sanremo Festival, the most famous and important Italian music competition. The resulting database models the last ten years of competition and considers Songs, Individuals, Bands, Authors, Genres and Editions as objects. The aim is to create a network that enables to easily navigate the relationships in the Italian music world through links like featurings, memberships and writing.

The data was downloaded using the spotify APIs and scraping web pages to retrieve information about the artists and the authors. A lot of data processing was required in order to fit together the daframes from the different sources. The final graph was created with the Neo4J framework.

You can check out the full paper (available only in Italian) describing all the steps in great detail at: [Grafo di brani e artisti delle ultime dieci edizioni del Festival di Sanremo](https://github.com/andreamaver/DataManagement/blob/main/DataMan_Maver_Radaelli_Zanotti.pdf "DataMan_Maver_Radaelli_Zanotti.pdf").
